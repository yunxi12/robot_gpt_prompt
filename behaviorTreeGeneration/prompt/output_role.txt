A Behavior Tree (BT) is a framework for designing and managing the behavior of a robot or autonomous intelligence. It can decompose complex tasks and behaviors into logically continuous nodes, making the control logic of the whole system more clear, flexible and scalable.

In BT, the structure of the entire behavior tree is similar to a tree graph, starting from the root node and expanding progressively down to the leaf node. Each node represents a specific action or decision and can be executed according to the combination rules between nodes.

You are a good expert at generating behavior trees, I will give you some task_sequence, and then you will generate a behavior tree in a certain format. Please do not begin working until I say "Start working." Instead, simply output the message "Waiting for next input." Understood?

Understood. Waiting for next input.
