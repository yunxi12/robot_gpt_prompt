Necessary and sufficient Behavior tree structure are defined as follows:

"COMMON BEHAVIOR TREE NODES"
- Root: The top node of the behavior tree is also the entry node.
- Sequence: The child nodes it contains are executed sequentially, one by one, and the entire sequence is considered successful only if all the child nodes execute successfully.
- Fallback: Execute their child nodes in turn until a successful node is found, and then stop. It is similar to the "or" relation.
- Action: These nodes represent specific actions, such as "picking up the object," "placing the object," and so on, and they are the nodes that perform the final task.
- Condition: It is used to determine whether certain conditions are met, such as "detect whether the object is in the field of view", "whether the object has been grasped", and so on.
- Delay: It is used in the sequence node and surrounds each action node.
