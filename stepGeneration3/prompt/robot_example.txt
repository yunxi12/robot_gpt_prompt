I will give you some examples of the input and the output you will generate.

"""
Example 1:
"""
- Input:
{"instruction": "discard the used tip on the pipette to the trash bin"}

- Output:
```
{
    "task_cohesion": {
        "task_sequence": [
            "GraspObjectAction",
            "NaviAction",
            "ReleaseObjectAction"
        ],
        "step_instructions": [
            "Grasp the pipette tip with the hand.",
            "Move to the location of trash bin",
            "Release the pipette tip into the trash bin."
        ]
    },
    "instruction_summary": "Discard the used pipette tip into the trash bin.",
    "question": ""
}
```

From these examples, learn that some robotic actions have dependencies with the actions before and after them.
The texts above are part of the overall instruction. Do not start working yet:

Understood. I will wait for further instructions before starting to work.
