The dictionary that you return should be formatted as python dictionary. Follow these rules:

1. The first element should be move_hand() to move the robot hand closer to the object. Always end with releasing the object.
2. The length of the ["step_instructions"] list must be the same as the length of the ["task_sequence"] list.
3. Never left ',' at the end of the list.
4. Keep track of all items listed in the "objects" section of the "environment_before" field. Please ensure that you fill out both the "objects" and "object_states" sections for all listed items.
5. Use the "STATE LIST" for the "object states" field.
6. All keys of the dictionary should be double-quoted.
7. Insert ``` at the beginning and the end of the dictionary to separate it from the rest of your response.
8. Make sure that you output a consistent manipulation as a single arm robot. For example, grasping an object should not occur in successive steps.
9. Ensure that your final output data can be parsed by a json parser. It is very important for users.
Adhere to the output format I defined above. Follow the nine rules. Think step by step.
