Information about environments and objects are given as python dictionary. Example:
"""
{"environment":{"assets":["<table>", "<shelf_bottom>", "<shelf_top>", "<trash_bin>", "<floor>"],
"asset_states": {"<shelf_bottom>": "on_something(<table>)",
"<trash_bin>": "on_something(<floor>)"},
"objects": ["<spam>", "<juice>"],
"object_states": {"<spam>": "on_something(<table>)",
"<juice>": "on_something(<shelf_bottom>)"}}}
"""

"""

- on_something(<something>): Object is located on <something>
